# Workflow overview

This vignette presents the overall workflow used by `cowfootR` to estimate dairy farm greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The flowchart below shows the main stages (data inputs, system boundaries, emission modules, aggregation, and reporting).

## What the diagram covers

- **Inputs**: Herd structure, milk production, feeds and purchased inputs, soils and manure management, energy, and other farm parameters.
- **System boundaries**: Definition of included and excluded processes for a consistent footprint (aligned with IPCC/IDF guidance).
- **Emission modules**: Enteric methane, manure, soils (N2O), energy, and indirect inputs.
- **Aggregation**: From module-level emissions to farm-level totals (CO2e).
- **Intensity metrics**: Emissions per litre FPCM and per hectare.
- **Reporting**: Batch and single-farm outputs, plus optional benchmarking.

## Reproducibility note

This is a documentation vignette. It does not run calculations itself; instead, it provides the conceptual map to help users navigate the package functions and data templates.
